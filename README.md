### [Lovelace] Horizontal Timeline Card - A new way to visualize your calendar events!

Hello everyone!

I'm excited to share a new custom card I've been working on: the **Horizontal Timeline Card**.

Its purpose is to provide a clean and simple way to visualize events from a calendar entity over a specific period. It's perfect for tracking project deadlines, upcoming birthdays, vacations, or any sequence of events you want to keep an eye on.

Here's a quick look at what it does:

### ‚ú® Features

* **Direct Calendar Integration**: Displays events from any Home Assistant `calendar` entity.
* **Customizable Date Range**: You define the start and end dates for the timeline.
* **"Today" Marker**: Automatically shows a vertical line for the current day.
* **Interactive Event Points**: Hover over any event on the timeline to see its name and date.
* **Collapsible Event List**: Includes an optional, expandable list below the timeline showing all event details.
* **Easy Configuration**: Fully configurable through the UI Editor, no YAML needed to get started.
* **Highly Customizable Look**:
    * Adjust colors for the timeline, event dots, and "today" marker.
    * Choose to show event labels permanently or only on hover.
    * Place labels above or below the timeline.
    * Set a fixed card height to fit your layout perfectly.
* **Smart & Manual Event Styling**:
    * **Auto-Color**: Automatically assigns a unique color to each event.
    * **Manual Override**: Customize the color and icon for specific events by adding a simple note in the event's description field in your calendar (e.g., `color: #ff4081` or `icon: mdi:cake-variant`).
